# fastMIP Phase 2 Repository

This repository will be gradually updated.

At present, it contains:
- A tour through the output we envision receiving from each modelling team
  (folder: [`requested_output`](requested_output/))
- Data describing the grid
  (folder: [`grid`](grid/))
- Python routines describing the aggregation to regions
  (folder: [`regions`](regions/))

Additional content will be added as the fastMIP Phase 2 progress evolves.

## Structure
**Important:** This structure may change as phase 2 develops.

├── grid/               # common grid definition and remapping
└── regions/            # regional aggregation utilities
